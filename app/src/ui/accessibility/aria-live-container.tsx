   *
   * For example, we have a search filter for a list of branches and we need to
   * announce how may results are found. Say a list of branches and the user
   * types "ma", the message becomes "1 result", but if they continue to type
   * "main" the message will have been interrupted.
   *
   * This prop allows us to pass in when the user input changes. This can either
   * be directly passing in the user input on change or a boolean representing
   * when we want the message re-read. We can append the invisible character to
   * force the screen reader to read the message again after each input. To
   * prevent the message from being read too much, we debounce the message.
